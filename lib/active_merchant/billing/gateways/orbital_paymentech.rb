    # ==== Authentication Options
    # 
    # The Orbital Gateway supports two methods of authenticating incoming requests:
    # Source IP authentication and Connection Username/Password authentication
    # 
    # In addition, these IP addresses/Connection Usernames must be affiliated with the Merchant IDs 
    # for which the client should be submitting transactions.
    # 
    # This does allow Third Party Hosting service organizations presenting on behalf of other 
    # merchants to submit transactions.  However, each time a new customer is added, the 
    # merchant or Third-Party hosting organization needs to ensure that the new Merchant IDs 
    # or Chain IDs are affiliated with the hosting companies IPs or Connection Usernames.
    # 
    # If the merchant expects to have more than one merchant account with the Orbital 
    # Gateway, it should have its IP addresses/Connection Usernames affiliated at the Chain 
    # level hierarchy within the Orbital Gateway.  Each time a new merchant ID is added, as
    # long as it is placed within the same Chain, it will simply work.  Otherwise, the additional 
    # MIDs will need to be affiliated with the merchant IPs or Connection Usernames respectively.
    # For example, we generally affiliate all Salem accounts [BIN 000001] with 
    # their Company Number [formerly called MA #] number so all MIDs or Divisions under that 
    # Company will automatically be affiliated.
